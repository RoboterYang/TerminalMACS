# How to realize the internationalization and localization of WPF prism module?

English | [简体中文](./2.PrismModuleI18n-zh_CN.md)

>In the previous article, I briefly introduced the internationalization of the main project, which is implemented by the resource dictionary (XAML).
In recent days, I have added several prism modules. I found that it is not easy to use resource dictionary to realize internationalization and localization of sub modules. I did not find a better reference article, so I changed the way to use resource file.

## 1. Overview of this article

Internationalization and localization requirements of sub modules:
- 1. Each module needs to have its own language file.
- 2. When the language is switched dynamically in the main project, the sub modules also need to switch along with it.
- 3. Prism is used to realize the modularization framework, which requires that the main project and each sub module can not have a reference relationship, that is, loose coupling, and can not directly switch the language files of sub modules in the main project.

Based on the above requirements, I try to define the language file (XAML) in each module. When the main window switches the language, loading the module language file always prompts that there is no corresponding resource dictionary file. I'm annoyed. I'll refer to the internationalization mode of "Accelerator.Windows" later, and use the resource file to realize localization and internationalization, and don't tangle the XAML mode, Alas.

Here is the modified effect:

Similarities and differences with the previous edition:
- 1. There is no change in the internationalization of the title block, but there is a different way of text binding, and the effect is the same.
- 2. Three sub modules (home \ client \ server) are added on the left side, which are dynamically loaded with prism and switched with the main project main form language switch.

The following is a brief introduction of how to create modules, and how to internationalize the main form and modules. It's really a very simple introduction. You can pull the code to see the specific implementation.

## 2. Add three prism modules

You can install prism templates and quickly create module projects. Of course, you can also create .NET Core projects manually. There are just a few more steps (you need to use nuget to install prism.wpf package (7.2.0.1422)). I used the prism templates to quickly create them.

### 2.1 Preparation before module creation
![VS2019 download prism template](https://imgkr.cn-bj.ufileos.com/928652da-44f1-4d8d-9472-bf4402e76980.png)

Download the prism template found in the figure above, restart vs, and it will be installed automatically. When you create a new project, you can select the prism module template:

![Prism template project](https://imgkr.cn-bj.ufileos.com/7814a9d2-e0f5-4d79-8d95-0faa20489e58.png)

Pay attention to selecting the version of .NET Core 3, because I am a WPF project created with. Net core.

### 2.2 Create module

Here are the screenshots of three modules that have been created:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.dotnet9.com/wpf_module_dir.png">
</p>

At present, the file organization structure of the three modules is similar:

- I18nresources: resource folder, where three language resource files and a T4 template file (used to reference language key) are placed. The T4 template file is defined the same in the three modules and the main project. For details, you can download the source code from GitHub.

- Views places the view file, and now only uses the tabitem view displayed in the main form of the main project, maintabitem.xaml, which inherits from tabitem.

- Xxxmodule.cs: prism template definition file, which is used by prism discovery module.

The key points of three modules need to be noted:

- 1. Edit the module project file and modify the module file output directory:
```C#
// Omit some code. The following line is set to false, which means that the output directory does not contain. Net core version information
<AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath>Flase</AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath>
// Omit part of the code, modify the output directory of debug and release compilation to facilitate the unified loading of modules in the main project
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|AnyCPU'">
  <OutputPath>..\Build\Debug\Modules</OutputPath>
</PropertyGroup>
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|AnyCPU'">
  <OutputPath>..\Build\Release\Modules</OutputPath>
</PropertyGroup>  
// Omit some codes
```
- 2. In xxxmodule, the ResourceManager reference of the resource file needs to be added to another library for saving, which needs to be used when switching languages. For example, add the following code to the homemodule's constructor, just add this code, and the internationalization and localization of the module will be finished：
```C#
I18nManager.Instance.Add(TerminalMACS.Home.I18nResources.UiResource.ResourceManager);
```

- 3. In the RegisterViewWithRegion method of XXXModule, register the view "MainTabItem" to "RegionNames.MainTabRegion". The main form uses the "regionnames. Maintabregion" association module view to display and load.
```C#
_regionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion(RegionNames.MainTabRegion, typeof(MainTabItem));
```
- 4. UI controls are bound with international text. An open source library namespace used by markup will be linked later. This project directly loads this library into the solution. I18nresources: language is the class generated by T4 template file, which is associated with the key of text translation. The code of binding text is as follows:
```HTML
<TextBlock Grid.Row="2" Text="{markup:I18n {x:Static i18NResources:Language.MainTabItm_Header}}"
```

## 3. Main project

The main project directory is organized as follows:

<p align="center">

### 3.1 Load prism module dynamically

The key code to configure and load the three modules is in the app.xaml.cs file. Look at the above code. I output the three modules to the modules directory. The main project can directly load this directory. Other loading methods include using configuration files. Please refer to the official prism example. The link is given at the end of the article:

```C#
protected override IModuleCatalog CreateModuleCatalog()
{
    string modulePath = @".\Modules";
    if (!Directory.Exists(modulePath))
    {
        Directory.CreateDirectory(modulePath);
    }
    return new DirectoryModuleCatalog() { ModulePath = modulePath };
}
```

The main window displays the tabitem view registered by the sub module. Prism: regionmanager.regionname is the region string registered in each sub module. It is associated with the corresponding tabitem view of the module. The code is as follows:

```HTML
<TabControl Grid.ColumnSpan="2" SelectedIndex="0"
    Style="{StaticResource MainTabControlStyle}" 
    ItemContainerStyle="{StaticResource MainTabItemStyle}"
    prism:RegionManager.RegionName="{x:Static ui:RegionNames.MainTabRegion}"/>
```

The main form displays the sub module view in the form of TabControl:

![Tabitem view for submodules](https://imgkr.cn-bj.ufileos.com/b40cf751-1408-43ce-961e-c3e6140800b5.png)


In order to load sub modules normally in the main project, the output directory of the project file of the main project also needs to be modified:
```C#
// Omit some code. The following line is set to false, which means that the output directory does not contain. Net core version information
<AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath>Flase</AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath>
// Omit part of the code, modify the output directory of debug and release compilation to facilitate the unified loading of modules in the main project
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|AnyCPU'">
  <OutputPath>..\Build\Debug</OutputPath>
</PropertyGroup>
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|AnyCPU'">
  <OutputPath>..\Build\Release</OutputPath>
</PropertyGroup>  
// Omit some codes
```

### 3.2 Modify language file format

Delete the original XAML language file and replace it with the resource file of resx. It is similar to the resource file types of the three modules. The following is the resource file of the main project:

![Use resource files as language files](https://imgkr.cn-bj.ufileos.com/5dec01de-2b73-4136-89ae-114059b87278.png)

To replace it with a resource file, editing is more convenient than XAML file. At first, it was considered to use the resource file to realize internationalization. I wanted to try XAML file to death.

### 3.3 Language switch core code

The key code of dynamic switching language is changed to:

```C#
public static void SetLanguage(string language = "")
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(language))
    {
        language = ConfigHelper.ReadKey(KEY_OF_LANGUAGE);
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(language))
        {
            language = System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.ToString();
        }
    }

    ConfigHelper.SetKey(KEY_OF_LANGUAGE, language);
    _lastLanguage = language;

    var culture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(language);
    I18nManager.Instance.CurrentUICulture = culture;
}
```

The core language switching code is the last sentence. I won't go into details. There are libraries and source codes in the solution:

```C#
I18nManager.Instance.CurrentUICulture = culture;
```
